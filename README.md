- 👋 Hi, I’m Randy Roach
- 👀 My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a passion for solving problems. Starting with iOS app development, I quickly expanded into full-stack web development using LAMP. But it was when I discovered the power of data that I found my true calling.
Now, I'm all about leveraging data to shape product strategy and drive business growth. I thrive on translating complex datasets into actionable insights that inform product decisions and enhance user experiences. My background in development gives me a unique edge in collaborating with tech teams and understanding product capabilities from the ground up.
As a product manager, I'm excited to combine my technical know-how with my data-driven approach to create products that truly resonate with users and deliver measurable business value.
