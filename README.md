- 👋 Hi, I’m Randy Roach
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data. I started off creating simple CRUM apps for IOS and transitioned into LAMP Stack web development, then I found something special, DATA.  I became fascinated with data and how to use it to help companies make solid business decisions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure databricks, DOCKER, SSIS, and Postgresql
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ETL projects
